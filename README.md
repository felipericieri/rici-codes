Nice to meet you, call me Rici. 👋

TL;DR: I’m passionate about what I do + I love to help people.

Mobile Engineering @ Kin + Carta, TechStars NYC '17 Alumni. Talk to me in 🇬🇧 & 🇧🇷 (🇮🇹 & 🇫🇷 beta).

I'm a friendly fast-learner engineer who love to work with interfaces. My goal in life is to connect as much people together as I possibly can (I'm an excellent vibe matchmaker). I've found a channel for my aim in digital products, so here I am - 10 years later - doing my thing with mobile applications.
