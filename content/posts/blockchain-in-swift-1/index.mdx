There are several cool things emerging lately in the decentralised ecosystem. My first contact with it was early this year, in February. Since then, I've being digging deeper and deeper. With the assistance of the Blockchain, we're able to drop the man-in-the-middle off from financial transactions and all sorts of agreements; and replace them with an automated piece of code hosted - and owned - by the community. This is a huge step forward!

I've been studying how Bitcoin and the Lightning Network works. Not only Satoshi's Blockchain actually, Vitalik's one as well. Ethereum and it's Web 3.0 is a revolution by itself.

#### The chain and the blocks

The most facinating concept I ever wanted to learn is how the heck mining a block in the blockchain works. It's an interesting piece of software, this one.

In a nutshell, in the Bitcoin's blockchain (and Ethereum 1.0) it is achieved by the adoption of a mechanism named [**Proof of Work**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work). To be able to push a new block to the chain, the Node (or Miner, in this context) needs to solve a mathematical problem first, which is to find a hash for the brand new block that starts with X zeros. 

**X** here is elastic. It expands and shrinks according to how many nodes are in the network and how often blocks are being minted. Satoshi hardcoded an interval of 10 minutes(-ish) for each new block. By the time I'm writting this article, the Miner needs to find a hash for their block that starts with **19 zeros** ðŸ˜§! 

It's as hard as simply as it sounds like. Just find this hash, and you can push your block. You send the "proof of work" (aka the hash for that block) to other nodes in the network so they can confirm that your block is legit, saving them the time (and energy!) to spend finding the same hash.

In its essence, a blockchain is a simple mechanism and can easily be simulated. I did an experiment in Swift that I'll be sharing in the next chapters. So if that's something you're interested in, stay tuned!
