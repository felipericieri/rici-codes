> Exploring the Nonce and playing with the Mining Service.

### Before you dive in

This article is part of the serie "Building a Blockchain in Swift". You can find [here](/building-a-blockchain-in-swift-intro) the Intro and [here](/building-a-blockchain-in-swift-part1) the Part. 1.

### The Nonce

Now that we have our blockchain settled and we know how the blocks and transactions work, let's take a look in the mining mechanism.

In our payload, we can't really change a thing. We should keep the block integrity, it should be added to the chain _ipsis literis_. So what can we add to block's structure that can be tweaked for this sake?

Introducing, the _**nonce**_.

This value is just a random number which main and only purpose is helping us find the "perfect" hash. The way we use it is to incrementing its value.

### Mining

In a live blockchain, this algorithm isn't part of the software. We are just putting it here for the experiment. This is the Node duty (and where all the gold relies), so it uses its own tailor-made solution.

```swift
final class MiningService {
  
  // 1.
  private let blockchainDifficulty: String
  
  init(difficulty: String) {
    blockchainDifficulty = difficulty
  }
  
  // 2.
  func mineBlock(previousBlock: Block, transactions: [Transaction]) -> Block {
    
    let nextHeight = previousBlock.height + 1
    print("‚õè Start mining block at height \(nextHeight)...")
    
    // 3. 
    let block = Block(height: nextHeight, previousHash: previousBlock.hash)
    transactions.forEach { block.add(transaction: $0) }
    
    // 4.
    let hash = generateHash(for: block)
    block.hash = hash
    
    return block
  }
  
  // 5.
  func generateHash(for block: Block) -> String {
    
    print("üîë Finding the hash for block at height \(block.height)...")
    var hash = block.key.toSHA1()
    
    // 6.
    while !hash.hasPrefix(blockchainDifficulty) {
      block.incrementNonce()
      hash = block.key.toSHA1()
      print(hash)
    }

    print("üôå Hash found! - \(hash)")
    return hash
  }
}
```

_Wow_, hold on! We have too much going on there. Let's break it down:
1. We create the service defining the blockchain difficulty we'll be working on. This is the amount of zeroes we'll need to find in a hash prefix so it can be accepted by the blockchain;
2. We set a `mineBlock()` method, that will take the previous block and the transactions that we want to register, then return the fresh new block;
3. We create a instance of the next block, and then add the transactions to it;
4. Then we need to generate the hash for this block. This will require some work from the node. Once it's down, we return the block;
5. The way we find the hash for the block is first to execute our SHA-1 function in the block key; and
6. Loop in to the hash value, incrementing the nonce, until we find a nonce that gives us a hash which is prefixed with the amount of zeroes the blockchain requires.

_P.S.: In this implementation I'm using a custom SHA-1 method which you can find it [here](https://gist.github.com/felipericieri/c296fa28198b8671a927ec550a522e53)_

You see, you don't have any guarantee that the `nonce` you're using next is the right one, so there's no other way apart from trial-and-error to find this value.

This is a very simple way to implement a Proof-of-Work consensus, but not so efficient. So feel free to explore other ways to implement yours!

The beauty behind this is that adds entropy to this problem. It's a fair play for all nodes in the network. Whichever finds the hash first, can mine the block.

### Putting all pieces together

Now we have enough to try to create our own blockchain. This is how we can use it:

```swift
// Exercise1.swift

// Creates the Mining Service
let miningService = MiningService(difficulty: "00") // starting with just 2 zeroes

// Generates Genesis Block
let genesisBlock = Block(height: 0, previousHash: "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000") // 40 zeroes

// Tries to find the hash for the genesis block
genesisBlock.hash = miningService.generateHash(for: genesisBlock)
// Once it finds the hash, create the Blockchain
do {
  let blockchain = try Blockchain(genesisBlock: genesisBlock)
  print("Blockchain is ready! üéâ")
} catch let _ {
  print("üö´ Oh-oh! The block hash isn't valid.")
}
```

If you execute the code above (you can use a Swift Playground for it), you should get some output similar to this one in your console:

```
üîë Searching the hash for block at height 0...
1CA360046CDE59C93CDAE5EC5A1A2DC7495D4A58
E42D0BBF1E810538CBDCE382C040B599A2DDADEE

....

üôå Hash found! - 006809C305F6F9790890E6D7C7319817F15FCEE0
Blockchain is ready! üéâ
```

> My machine needed to run the function 218 times to find a hash for the genesis block! Picture how many times it would take to find a block with today's difficulty! üò¨

### Adding Transactions

Now you have a blockchain you can push transactions to! Let's try to transfer some value to people:

```swift
// (Assumes the Exercise1.swift preceds)

// Creates a new block
let transaction = Transaction(sender: "Felipe", receiver: "Tim Cook", amount: 100)

let newBlock = miningService.mineBlock(previousBlock: genesisBlock, transactions: [transaction])

do {
  try blockchain.add(block: newBlock)
} catch let _ {
  print("üö´ Oh-oh! The block hash isn't valid.")
}
```

In your console, you should get something like this:

```
‚õè Starting to mine the block at height 1...
üîë Searching the hash for block at height 1...
C84DA890248ED95DF39E7AD15CACE49EA57BD6A4

üôå Hash found! - 00B33255769C3A5CD38E757D2C31E8CF2ACDF3C2
```

> This time the function ran for 116 times!

And that's how your blockchain should look like when printed as a JSON object:

```json
{
  "blocks": [
    {
      "nonce": 218,
      "previousHash": "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
      "hash": "006809C305F6F9790890E6D7C7319817F15FCEE0",
      "transactions": [],
      "height": 0
    },
    {
      "nonce": 116,
      "previousHash": "006809C305F6F9790890E6D7C7319817F15FCEE0",
      "hash": "00B33255769C3A5CD38E757D2C31E8CF2ACDF3C2",
      "transactions": [
        {
          "sender": "Felipe",
          "receiver": "Tim Cook",
          "amount": 100
        }
      ],
      "height": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

### Wrapping up

We've just written our first Blockchain in Swift! üçæ

As I've mentioned earlier, we aren't using the most efficient algorithm to find the hash, but that's a great start. That isn't the only protocol out there, though. Most advanced blockchains nowadays use protocols such as **Proof-of-Stake**, **Proof-of-Authority**, **Proof-of-Space**, and many others.
