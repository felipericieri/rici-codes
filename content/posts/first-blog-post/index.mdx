Welcome to Rici's Coding Soup. I share my latest discoveries here. As well as random thoughts about software engineering (mostly). At the time of this post is being written, I'm starting my journey in React Native (after spending over 10 years working only with native mobile development). 

I hope you have fun. That's what life is all about, after all.

Enjoy.
